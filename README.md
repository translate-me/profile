# Profile

## Run project

2. Use command:
> docker-compose up --build

Obs: Is important verify if your docker have sudo permission to execute commands

## Development tips
1. Watchout about docker's container, because if containers don't setup at begin of development time the application doesn't work.
2. Watchout about structure of django framework and rest framework.
3. If you create or modify a model remember of create and execute migrations. To make that you need:

> docker-compose exec profile ash
> python3 manage.py makemigrations
> python3 manage.py migrate

4. If you need new requirement add the package and the package's version at api/requirement.txt and
execute build of container again.
5. To start new app on application you need.
> docker-compose exec profile ash
> python3 manage.py startapp <"name of app">

6. Watchout, when you execute some command inside docker you are executing sudo commands, because of that you need execute:
> sudo chmod -R 777 <"project folder">

After that you can commit your work.
7. Remember of don't commit migrations and caches.
8. The volume of docker are build inside docker's container that mean you don't have code inside container. You can code in your local machine and the changes will be inside docker.
